Support rendering of Events in surfer ( VarType::Event  VariableType::VCDEvent )

VCD events are a special type of signal in GTKWave that represent discrete occurrences at specific time points,
unlike regular signals that maintain state between transitions.

- Events are drawn as vertical lines with arrow indicators
- Unlike regular signals, events don't connect horizontally between time points
- Events are only rendered if they occur at or after the first visible time
- Events always render with standard orientation
- Events skip horizontal line drawing between transitions
- No state interpolation between events

After implementation is complete, add snapshot based test to libsurfer/src/tests/snapshot.rs
that will use examples/event.vcd
( use existing tests for examples/counter.vcd as reference )

This assignment requires detailed codebase analysis, as there are many way to implement event support,
and careful design choices are required. Don't jump into coding, instead first write detailed plan with sw design and required changes.
And then work on implementation and testing.
