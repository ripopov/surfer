<!--

Thanks for opening an issue to help improving Surfer.

If you find an error loading a file, please include the file
(ideally an as small as possible file that still produces the
error).

In some situations the error comes from the wellen library that
is used to read waveform files (VCD, FST, GHW). Hence, you may
also want to open an issue there as well:
https://github.com/ekiwi/wellen/issues

This holds especially for GHW files, where the support is know
to be limited.

Note, if you do not want to make your waveform file public,
you create a confidential issue. In that way, only the Surfer
maintainers get access to your waveform file for debugging.
