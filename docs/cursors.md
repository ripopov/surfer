# Cursor and markers

In Surfer, the cursor is the vertical line that can be positioned by clicking the primary mouse button. The cursor will snap to a nearby transition if there is a waveform below.

There are also numbered markers. These are created from the cursor location, either by right-clicking and selecting New (or a number to redefine an existing), or by pressing Ctrl+0-9 (Cmd+0-9 on MacOS).

Although only marker 0 to 9 can be directly accessed using keyboard commands, there is support for up to 255 markers, numbered

It is possible to center on a marker by pressing 0-9.

The number shown in the column usually showing variable values of waveforms is the difference in time to the current cursor location.

## Cursor and marker window

By pressing space and typing `show_marker_window` a rudimentary window showing differences between all defined markers and the cursor (primary) is shown. It is possible to center a marker/cursor by pressing on the name of the marker/cursor.
