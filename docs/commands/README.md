# Commands

To execute a command, press space and type the command. There is fuzzy match support, so it is enough to type parts of the command name and it will display options that matches.

It is also possible to create a command file, extension `.sucl`, and run that. Running a command file can be done from within Surfer using the menu option in the File menu, through the toolbar button, or by typing the command ``run_command_file``. It can also be done using the ``--command-file`` argument when starting Surfer.

Not all commands are available unless a file is loaded. Also, some commands are not available in the WASM-build (browser/VS Code extension).

## Waveform/transaction loading and reloading

* ``load_file <FILE_NAME>``

    Load a file. Note that it works to load a waveform file from a command file.

    <div class="warning">In WASM-builds (web browser/VS Code plugin) it is not possible to open a file due to file access restrictions. Use <tt>load_url</tt>.</div>


* ``switch_file <FILE_NAME>``

    Load file, but keep waveform view.

* ``load_url <URL>``

    Load a URL.

* ``reload``

    Reload the current file. Does not work in a web browser.

* ``remove_unavailable``

    Remove variables that are not longer present in the reloaded/switched file.

## Add variable/transaction items

* ``scope_add <SCOPE_NAME>``, ``stream_add``, ``module_add``

    Add all variables in the specified scope to the waveform display. ``module_add`` is an alias for ``scope_add``.

* ``scope_add_recursive <SCOPE_NAME>``

    Add all variables in the specified scope and from all sub-scopes to the waveform display.

    <div class="warning">Adding large hierarchies with a large number of variables can freeze surfer for a significant amount of time.</div>

* ``scope_add_as_group <SCOPE_NAME>``

    Add all variables in the specified scope to the waveform display in a newly created group of the same name.

* ``scope_add_as_group_recursive <SCOPE_NAME>``

## Frame buffer

* ``frame_buffer_set_array <SCOPE_NAME>`` / ``frame_buffer_set_variable <VARIABLE_NAME>``

  Set the data source for the frame buffer. Use ``frame_buffer_set_array`` to source pixel data
  from a memory array (a scope), or ``frame_buffer_set_variable`` to source it from a single
  variable.

* ``frame_buffer_set_mode <grayscale | rgb | ycbcr> <BITS> [BITS2 BITS3]``

  Set the color mode and bit widths used when decoding pixels.

  * ``grayscale <BITS>`` — each pixel is a single grey value of `BITS` bits (1–8).
  * ``rgb <R_BITS> <G_BITS> <B_BITS>`` — each pixel is packed as red/green/blue with the given bit widths (each 0–8).
  * ``ycbcr <Y_BITS> <CB_BITS> <CR_BITS>`` — each pixel is packed as Y/Cb/Cr (BT.601) with the given bit widths (each 0–8).

  Examples:

  ```
  frame_buffer_set_mode grayscale 8
  frame_buffer_set_mode rgb 5 6 5
  frame_buffer_set_mode ycbcr 8 8 8
  ```

* ``frame_buffer_set_width <WIDTH>``

  Set the number of pixels per row in the frame buffer display.

* ``frame_buffer_set_range <FIRST> <LAST> [FIRST2 LAST2 ...]``

  Set the displayed index range for each array level. Pairs of integers are matched to levels
  in order; extra pairs beyond the number of levels are ignored. Each value is clamped to the
  valid range of its level, and if `FIRST` > `LAST` the values are swapped automatically.

  Example — set level 0 to rows 0–479 and level 1 to columns 0–639:

  ```
  frame_buffer_set_range 0 479 0 639
  ```

## Memory viewer

* ``memory_viewer_open <SCOPE_NAME>``

  Open a memory viewer window for the given array (scope).

## Tiles

The central area is a workspace of tiles: waveform views, memory viewers,
markers, logs, annotations and frame buffers arranged in splits and tab
groups. Tile commands act on the tile that was focused when the command
prompt opened; waveform commands from the prompt fall back to the most
recently focused waveform tile. Layout commands work without a loaded file.

* ``tile_new <KIND>``

  Open a tile of the given kind (``waveform``, ``memory``, ``markers``,
  ``logs``, ``annotation_list``, ``frame_buffer``, ``transaction_details``)
  to the right of the focused tile, or as the only tile of an empty workspace.
  Singleton kinds are revealed instead of duplicated.

* ``tile_split_right``, ``tile_split_down``

  Split the focused tile. A waveform split is *linked*: the new view shows the
  same items with its own zoom, scroll and focus. Other kinds are cloned when
  they support it.

* ``tile_split_copy_right``, ``tile_split_copy_down``

  Split the focused waveform into an independent copy of its item list.

* ``tile_close``, ``tile_close_others``

  Close the focused tile, or every other tab in its group. Closing the last
  view of an item list drops the list; both are undoable.

* ``tile_focus <#ID | TITLE>``

  Reveal and focus a tile by numeric ID or (unique prefix of its) title.

* ``tile_focus_left``, ``tile_focus_right``, ``tile_focus_up``, ``tile_focus_down``

  Focus the visible spatial neighbor.

* ``tile_next``, ``tile_prev``

  Activate the adjacent tab in the focused tile's group.

* ``tile_move_left``, ``tile_move_right``, ``tile_move_up``, ``tile_move_down``

  Move the focused tile one step past its neighbor, or to the workspace edge.

* ``tile_rename <NAME>``

  Give the focused tile a custom title; an empty name restores the default.

* ``workspace_reset``

  Keep only the target waveform tile (creating an empty one if none exists).

* ``tile_columns both|names|values|none``, ``tile_link_scroll on|off``

  Waveform tile settings: which columns to show and whether vertical scrolling
  is shared with linked views of the same items. Offered only while a waveform
  tile is focused.

The ``source_code`` tile is a singleton view opened from a signal's context
menu when a VDB sidecar provides source metadata. Its file, line anchor, viewed
design instance and value layout are stored in the workspace; source text
remains outside the waveform document. When the sidecar carries a
``source_index`` section, written by the simulator build, the tile shows
accurate highlighting, the value of every referenced signal at the cursor,
ctrl-click navigation and alt-click adding of signals without starting any
process (see ``docs/html/source-code.html``).

* ``source_values trailing|inline``

  Where the source tile draws cursor values: after the code of each line, or as
  chips after each identifier. Offered while a source tile is focused; the
  header of the tile has the same switch, and ``[source] values_layout`` in the
  config sets the default.

* ``logs_filter off|error|warn|info|debug|trace``, ``annotation_list_comments on|off``

  Settings offered while the logs or annotation tile is focused.

## Viewports

The following spellings are kept for older command files; each resolves to a
tile command on the current target waveform.

* ``viewport_add``

  Linked split of the target waveform tile to the right (``tile_split_right``).

* ``viewport_remove``

  Close the target waveform tile (``tile_close``).

* ``viewport_set_active <INDEX>``

  Focus the ``INDEX``-th waveform tile in layout order.
  Command completion suggests currently available indices.

## State files

* ``load_state <FILE_NAME>``

  Load a previously saved state file.

* ``save_state``

  Save the current state to the default state file.

* ``save_state_as <FILE_NAME>``

  Save the current state to the given file.

## Command files

* ``run_command_file <FILE_NAME>`` (not on WASM)

    Run the commands in the given file.

    <div class="warning">In WASM-builds (web browser/VS Code plugin) it is not possible to run another command file from a command file due to file access restrictions.</div>

* ``run_command_file_from_url <URL>``

    Run the commands at the given URL.

## Surver (streaming waveform server)

* ``surver_select_file <FILE_NAME>``

  Load a file from the connected Surver instance, discarding the current waveform view.

* ``surver_switch_file <FILE_NAME>``

  Load a file from the connected Surver instance, keeping the current waveform view.

## Waveform control protocol (WCP)

* ``wcp_server_start`` (not WASM)

  Start the [WCP](https://gitlab.com/waveform-control-protocol/wcp/) server.
  Typically, this is using port 54321 at address 127.0.0.1, but this can be changed
  using the `address` setting in the `wcp` part of the config file.

* ``wcp_server_stop`` (not WASM)

  Stop the WCP server.

* ``unpause_simulation``

  Resume a paused simulation.

## Debugging

* ``dump_tree``

  Print the current displayed item tree to the log.

* ``show_performance`` (performance_plot feature only)
